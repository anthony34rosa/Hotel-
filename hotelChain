 * Pseudocode or Algorithm for the program:
  1. Start.
  2. Make variables and constants.
  3. Ask user for the number of floors in hotel, validate to make sure number entered is correct.
  4. Ask user for the number of available rooms on every floor, validate to make sure number entered is correct
  5. Ask the user for the number of each type of booked room on every floor, make sure number is note greater then the one entered, if so redo previous step.
  6. Calculate number of available rooms, occupied rooms, occupancy rate, price, and room with least number of available rooms.
  7. Display information accordingly.
  8. If occupancy rate is below 60%, display message to improve occupancy.
  9. Display programer
  10. due date
  11. Project number
  12. End
